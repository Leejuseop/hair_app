# Texture Baker Loader

This folder contains the first generic loader for the observed-photo face
texture baker. It resolves private Drive paths and reports the frozen mesh
candidates plus per-frame crop, UV, segmentation, landmark, and crop metadata
inputs.

It does not copy private photos, meshes, masks, textures, or renders into Git.

## Local Windows Check

```powershell
python experiments\texture_baker\texture_baker_loader.py `
  --private-root "G:\내 드라이브\hair_app"
```

## Colab Check

Run this after cloning or pulling the repository in Colab:

```python
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount("/content/drive")

%cd /content/hair_app
!git pull --ff-only
!python experiments/texture_baker/texture_baker_loader.py \
  --private-root /content/drive/MyDrive/hair_app
```

Expected current bundles:

- `주섭`: three frozen mesh candidates from
  `output/주섭/models/model_trio_for_texture/model_trio_manifest.json`.
- `은채`: two mesh candidates from `output/은채/models/models_manifest.json`.

The loader accepts both Colab paths such as
`/content/drive/MyDrive/hair_app/...` and local Windows paths such as
`G:\내 드라이브\hair_app\...`.
